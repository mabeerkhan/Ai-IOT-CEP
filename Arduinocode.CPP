Arduino IoT Cloud Variables description
The following variables are automatically generated and updated when changes are made to the Thing
float humidity;
float temperature;
bool fan;
bool light;
Variables which are marked as READ/WRITE in the Cloud Thing will also have functions
which are called when their values are changed from the Dashboard.
These functions are generated with the Thing and added at the end of this sketch.
